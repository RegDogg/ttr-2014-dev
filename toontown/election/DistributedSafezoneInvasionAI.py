     INVASION-RELATED
       There are 4 types of Invasion waves: Normal, Wait, Intermission, and Finale.
       - Normal Waves simply spawn cogs and move on to the next wave as soon as the cogs have landed.
       - Wait Waives will wait until all cogs in the current wave are destroyed before moving to the next.
       - Intermission Waves wait a certain amount of time defined in InvasionGlobals before spawning the next wave. These are used to separate the Levels of cogs.
       - The Finale Wave is only used once as soon as all other waves are done. It spawns our boss, which ends the invasion upon death.

       Although each set of cogs is called a "wave", this is only to prevent too many cogs from spawning.
       To the players, each wave visually ends as soon as an Intermission is called.
